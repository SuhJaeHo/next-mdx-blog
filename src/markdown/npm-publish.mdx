### Why Rollup

1. Simpler Configuration
2. Supports powerful tree shaking
3. Optimized for ES Modules

### Rollup Configuration

<p>Defines how Rollup should bundle code</p>

- @rollup/plugin-babel
  <br />
  Integrates Babel into the Rollup bundling process.
  <details>
    <summary>What is babel preset</summary>
    <p>Babel by itself is a tool for transforming Javascript, but it doesn't do anything on its own.</p>
    <p>To make Babel what to transform and how to do, need to install a plugin and preset is bundled of plugins which make it easier to configure Babel</p>
  </details>
- @rollup/plugin-typescript
  <br />
  <p>Allows rollup to compile Typescript code to Javascript in a build process with integrates tsc.</p>
  <p>Run tsc seperately, as this Rollup plugin doesn't perform type-checking.</p>
- @rollup/plugin-node-resolve
  <br />
  <p>Allows rollup to find external dependencies and bundle them properly.</p>
  <p>It helps in cases where your react component imports libraries from node_modules.</p>
- @rollup/plugin-commonjs
  <br />
  <p>By default, Rollup only supports ES Modules for imports and exports, but many libraries are written in CommonJS.</p>
  <p>It allows Rollup to handle modules written in the CommonJS</p>
- rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external
  <br />
  <p>Mark peer dependencies automatically as external in Rollup bundle.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>What is Peer Dependencies</summary>
    <p>Peer dependencies are libraies that instead of bundling them with your package, you let user install and manage them.</p>
    <p>Prevent bundling common dependencies such as react, react-dom, styled-components.</p>
  </details>
- rollup-plugin-postcss

```js
import babel from "@rollup/plugin-babel";
import commonjs from "@rollup/plugin-commonjs";
import typescript from "@rollup/plugin-typescript";
import resolve from "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve";
import peerDepsExternal from "rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external";
import postcss from "rollup-plugin-postcss";
import { terser } from "rollup-plugin-terser";
import autoprefixer from "autoprefixer";
import tailwindcss from "tailwindcss";

export default {
  input: "src/index.ts",
  output: [
    {
      file: "dist/index.js",
      format: "cjs",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
    {
      file: "dist/index.esm.js",
      format: "esm",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    babel({
      babelHelpers: "bundled",
      exclude: "node_modules/**",
      presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
      extensions: [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"],
    }),
    typescript(),
    peerDepsExternal(),
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
    postcss({
      extract: true,
      minimize: true,
      postcss({
        extract: true,
        minimize: true,
      }),
    }),
    terser(),
  ],
};
```

### Typescript Configuration

<p>Defines how Typescript should be compiled</p>

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // "lib": Specifies which set of built-in type definitions the TypeScript compiler should include for project
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    // "target": Specifies which version of JavaScript TypeScript should compile
    "target": "esnext",
    // "module": Defines which module system to use in the generated Javascript
    "module": "esnext",
    // "jsx": Controls how Typescript handle JSX during compilation
    // The task of transforming JSX is passed to Babel instead of being handled during Typescript compilation
    "jsx": "preserve",
    // "declaration": Generate declaration files of Typescript
    "declaration": true,
    // "declarationDir" : Specifies the directory where the generated declaration files should be placed
    "declarationDir": "dist/types",
    // "emitDeclarationOnly" : Type checking with emit declaration files without emit Javascript files
    "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
    // "moduleResolution": Determines how TypeScript resolves modules when importing them into code
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  // "include" : Specifies an array of files that should be included in Typescript compilation process.
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

### Package.json

- main
  <br />
  <p>The entry point of package when it is required by CommonJS environments.</p>
- module
  <br />
  <p>The entry point of ES Module versions of package.</p>
  <p>It is intended for Javascript environments that support ECMAScript Modules.</p>
- files
  <br />
  <p>Specifies which files and directories should be included in npm package whein it is published.</p>
